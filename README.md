# Liri-Node-App
### Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

* LIRI is a command line node app that will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

* It takes in two parameters/arguments and gives you the output based on the search.

## Here's how the app works:
* You can get information about
 
    * where your favorite artist is performing next
    * your favourite song
    * your favourite movie

* These are the commands that can be given to get the info,

  * `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`
  * `node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name here>`
  * `node liri.js movie-this <movie name here>`
  * `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
